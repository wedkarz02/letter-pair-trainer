# Letter Pair Trainer

A flashcard-like script created to help learning letter pairs from an excel sheet.\
The program will prompt you with a random combination of two letters from your sheet and start the countdown of three seconds, after which it will show the correct letter pair.\
Script was written in python 3.9.7 and is designed specifically for Windows (although might also work on other operating systems)
